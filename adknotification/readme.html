			<li><a href="#conf-appearance">Set notification appearance.</a></li>
			<li><a href="#conf-pos">Choose place at the store where notification should appear.</a></li>
			<li><a href="#conf-event">Choose notifications' event - condition to show/hide notification.</a></li>
			<li><a href="#conf-save"><b>Save notification</b>.</a></li>

		<h4 id="conf-text"><strong>7.1 Notification text</strong> - <a href="#configs-list">top</a></h4>
		<p>
			To change notification text you need to type in it in <b>Notification Text</b> input field. Also you can use set of predefined functions to get environment specific values: shopping cart subtotal, current time etc. For example you want tell customer, that in order to get free shipping, he or she need to make purchase for specific amount. To make that type in something like this: 'To get free shipping spend another freeShipping()'. Where freeShipping() is a function, which calculates difference between minimum free shipping amount and cart subtotal. So in result you'll get this: 'To get free shipping spend another 25$'. In order to make the function work properly you need type in her name literally with parentheses and arguments (if applied). List of all supported functions you can find at <b>Notification Text</b> field description. Functions description and list of supported arguments you can see in tool-tip when clicking on circle with question mark, which placed opposite of each function.

		<p>
			You can change almost every aspect of notification appearance using appearance controls (fig. 3). These changes will be reflected by <b>Notification Preview</b>. One thing you should be aware of is that notification implements responsive design, so you set notification width in percents of available space, and real width will depend on specific page and theme.

		</p>

		<span>Figure 4. Notification position options</span>

		<h4 id="conf-event"><strong>7.4 Events</strong> - <a href="#configs-list">top</a></h4>
		<p>
			To configure the notifications display logic you need activate desired events. All events have two options: show and hide. Exception is event always, which has only show option. It means when an event is enabled notification will be shown or hidden depend on its settings. Each event has priority, regarding its position in events list (fig. 5). The higher event's position - the higher its priority. You can change event's priority by dragging it in the list. Events logic is following: first enabled event, which is matched, will fire, and notification will be shown or hidden depend on its option.
		</p>
		<img class="figure" src="assets/img/smart_notifications_events.png">
		<span>Figure 5. Notification's events</span>

		<p>
			For example, if you want that notification will be shown alway, but not when cart has product with specific category. To do it drag event <b>Categories</b> higher than event <b>Always</b> (fig. 5). In event <b>Categories</b>  select desired category, set option hide and enable events <b>Categories</b> and <b>Always</b>.
